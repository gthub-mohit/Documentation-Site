# DevDocs — Personal Engineering Log

DevDocs is my personal engineering log — a living documentation site that tracks how my understanding evolves across different areas of computer science and software development.

This is **not** a tutorial website or a notes dump.
It is intentionally concise and grows only when concepts are used, revisited, or understood deeply through practice.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to:
- Maintain a structured record of what I am learning
- Document *why* certain approaches work, not just *how*
- Capture insights, mistakes, and patterns discovered during problem solving and projects
- Avoid passive note-taking and focus on applied understanding

Empty or minimal sections are intentional and represent areas currently being explored.

---

## What This Is
- A personal documentation system
- An evolving knowledge base
- A reflection of my learning process
- A single source of truth for concepts I actively use

## What This Is Not
- A complete reference guide
- Exam-oriented notes
- Copy-pasted tutorials
- Finished or static documentation

---

## Current Areas Covered
- C Programming
- C++
- HTML & CSS
- JavaScript (in progress)
- Competitive Programming
- Data Structures
- Game Development
- Robotics (conceptual)

Sections expand organically as concepts are applied in real problems and projects.

---

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- Minimal JavaScript (for navigation and UI behavior)

No frameworks — built from scratch to focus on fundamentals.

---

## Status
This project is **actively evolving**.
Content will be updated incrementally as learning progresses.

---

## Philosophy

> Write less. Understand more.  
> Document only what survives real use.

## License
Personal project. No license required.
